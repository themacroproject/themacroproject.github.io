# The Macro Project

Macro keyboards are specialized keyboards that are designed to help users automate repetitive tasks and streamline their workflow. Whether you're a gamer looking to gain an edge in your favorite games, or a professional looking to increase your productivity, a macro keyboard can be an invaluable tool.

At their core, macro keyboards are designed to allow users to assign specific actions or commands to individual keys or key combinations. This means that, rather than having to manually perform a series of actions every time you need to complete a task, you can simply press a single key or key combination to execute the entire series of actions at once.


## Features

- Programmable keys: Macro keyboards typically have a set of keys that can be programmed to perform specific actions or commands.

- Onboard memory: Many macro keyboards have built-in memory that allows users to store and recall their custom macro settings.

- Customizable backlighting: Some macro keyboards allow users to customize the color and brightness of the backlighting, which can be useful for gaming and other applications.

- Media keys: Many macro keyboards include dedicated media keys that allow users to control music and video playback without having to switch to another application.

- Extra keys: Some macro keyboards feature additional keys beyond the standard keyboard layout, such as a numeric keypad or macro keys.

- Macro Software: Many macro keyboards come with software that allows users to record and manage macros, as well as customize the settings of the keyboard.

- Mechanical switches: Macro keyboards are often designed with mechanical switches, which are known for their durability and tactile feedback, making them popular among gamers and typists
